                    <br/>

                    Your Personal Data isn’t just protected by the quality, commitment and high standards of bet365, it’s also protected by law. The law states that we can only process your Personal Data when there is a genuine reason to do so and it must be one of the following:
                    <br/>

                    • To fulfil any contract that we have with you
                    <br/>

                    • We have a legal obligation
                    <br/>
                    • Where you have consented to the processing
                    <br/>
                    • When it is in our legitimate interest
                    <br/>
                    • When it is in the public interest
                    <br/>

                    • When it is in your vital interests
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>Legitimate Interests</b>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    When we have a business or commercial reason to process your Personal Data this is referred to as a legitimate interest. Your Personal Data is still protected and we must not process it in a way that would be unfair to you or your interests.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    If we do use legitimate interests as a reason to process your Personal Data we will tell you that we are doing so, what our legitimate interests are and provide you with a method to raise any questions or objections you may have. However, compelling grounds for processing such information may over-ride your right to object.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>How long we keep your Personal Data</b>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    Whenever your data is kept by bet365 we will ensure that it is appropriately protected and only used for acceptable purposes.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    We will keep your data for the period that you are a customer of bet365.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    If you are no longer a customer of bet365, we will keep your data for the minimum length of time required to comply with the purposes set out in this policy and relevant legal or regulatory obligations. Your Personal Data may be kept longer if we cannot delete it for technical reasons.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
